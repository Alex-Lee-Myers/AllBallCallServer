## FAQ

#### What is the stack?

P.E.R.N. (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js)

#### What type of technologies were used?

Due to the nature of this project being required to reach MVP within 25 days, from server to client side, a host of packages were implemented to quicken progress on the client side. 

- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 3.0

- React-Player

#### Who designed the logo? 

Well, I did! I have ove

#### Who designed the logo? 

Well, I did! I have over half a decade of experience in Illustrator and spent around 30 minutes on producing it.

#### What was your inspiration?

I am a die-hard NBA fan. In the midst of working a full-time job as well as averaging 5 hours a night coding for my part-time bootcamp with Eleven Fifty Academy, I was unable to watch any games or keep up. I started to rely on Twitter or Reddit.com/r/NBA for highlights yet both were cumbersome to do so. I wanted a one-stop shop where I could find the highlights I wanted to see --- so I decided to make it myself.

#### Do you plan on doing upkeep with this project and continuining its development?

Yes! Soon enough I will provide an experience beyond the scope of my intensive class. I may make it open-source in the future as well as I'd love to work with the community to build the best experience for all.

Ran into extreme issues with PostgreSQL on my host computer that set me back a few hours. I ended up having to manually seek out all PostgreSQL related files within /AppData, /ProgramFiles, etc., delete them, then reinstall PostgreSQL from scratch.  |
| [*1/23/22*](https://github.com/Alex-Lee-Myers/AllBallCallServer/commit/c6422976577104e6ba0784c0e8f187999dc833a3)  | After snafu of previous day, spent nearly 10 hours on development of my server mostly betweem researching database associations, applying them, and continuing to narrow down the tables I'd need for MVP.|
| [*1/24/22* P.1](https://trello.com/b/LuH1VGa7/red-badge-allballcall) | Trello Board created. |
| [*1/24/22* P.2](https://github.com/Alex-Lee-Myers/AllBallCallServer/commit/44820135ac16a0cb5b13003f28f60f6a52fa9923)  | Continued finalizing database associations. Ran into issues with primary keys conflicting with foreign keys. Setup some potential stretch goal tables/models regarding bookmarks and upvote features. |
| [*1/25/22*](https://github.com/Alex-Lee-Myers/AllBallCallServer/commit/48c58cd370d9b799d0c5c728d6087bb45a57e300)  | Debugged my issues with table's being set incorrectly and now fully functional, tested all endpoints as well. |

Built out extremely limited React-Router-Dom. Debugged issues ts-node was flagging regarding it. Still need to figure out drop-down of the Portfolio and create terenary depending on isLoggedIn state for Logout+Signin/Register.  |
| [*1/27/22* P.1](https://github.com/Alex-Lee-Myers/AllBallCallClient/commit/8c84411ec2918f78133e8edc4fdb866aafffdd1b)  | Tested ReactPlayer functionality. Minimal Tailwind UI integration with a card-style grid. Base structure working. Need to move to Home.tsx and then integrate fetching the server. |
| [*1/27/22* P.2](https://github.com/Alex-Lee-Myers/AllBallCallClient/commit/142f52780f6baf70d168ccc10a470e8e4b03d40f)  | Started build up of Login UI. Needs a lot more work before functional.
