## FAQ

#### What is the stack?

P.E.R.N. (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js)

#### What type of technologies were used?

Due to the nature of this project being required to reach MVP within 25 days, from server to client side, a host of packages were implemented to quicken progress on the server side. 

- BcrpytJS
- Express
- .env
- JsonWebToken
- PostgreSQL
- Sequelize
- UUID

#### Who designed the logo? 

Well, I did! I have over half a decade of experience in Illustrator and spent around 30 minutes on producing it.

#### What was your inspiration?

I am a die-hard NBA fan. In the midst of working a full-time job as well as averaging 5 hours a night coding for my part-time bootcamp with Eleven Fifty Academy, I was unable to watch any games or keep up. I started to rely on Twitter or Reddit.com/r/NBA for highlights yet both were cumbersome to do so. I wanted a one-stop shop where I could find the highlights I wanted to see --- so I decided to make it myself.

#### Do you plan on doing upkeep with this project and continuining its development?

Yes! Soon enough I will provide an experience beyond the scope of my intensive class. I may make it open-source in the future as well as I'd love to work with the community to build the best experience for all.

#### Are you looking for a job?

Indeed I am. Feel free to reach out to me via my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexleemyers/) if you have positions available for front-end, back-end, and/or full-stack.

Ran into extreme issues with PostgreSQL on my host computer that set me back a few hours.

For reference, it was the first time I ran into any CORS issues, and it happened to be in the middle of my presentation. Oh well! Demo day trials are like that sometimes. Ran multiple attempted fixes through Heroku and eventually found a fix with the use of whitelisting the client. It is now working on live Heroku build! Although, it seems on Logout() that a CORS error arises, but after refreshing it works again. |
